\title{hmi: Hierarchical Multilevel Imputation.}
\usage{
hmi(data, model_formula = NULL, M = 10, maxit = 5, list_of_types = NULL,
  nitt = 3000, thin = 100, burnin = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{data.frame} with all variables appearing in \code{model_formula}.}

\item{model_formula}{A \code{\link[stats]{formula}} used for the analysis model.
Currently the package is designed to handle formula used in
\code{lm}, \code{glm} and \code{lmer}.}

\item{M}{An integer defining the number of imputations that should be made.}

\item{maxit}{An integer defining the number of times the imputation cycle
(imputing \eqn{x_1|x_{-1} then x_2|x_{-2}, ... x_p|x_{-p}}) shall be repeated.
The task of checking convergence is left to the user, by evaluating the chainMean and chainVar!}

\item{list_of_types}{a list where each list element has the name of a variable
in the data.frame. The elements has to contain a single character denoting the type of the variable.
See \code{get_type} for details about the variable types.
With the function \code{list_of_types_maker}, the user can get the framework for this object.
In most scenarios this is shouldn't be necessary.
One example where it might be necessary is when only two observations
of a continouos variable are left - because in this case \code{get_type}
interprete is variable to be binary. Wrong is it in no case.}

\item{nitt}{An integer defining number of MCMC iterations (see \code{MCMCglmm}).}

\item{thin}{An integer defining the thinning interval (see \code{MCMCglmm}).}

\item{burnin}{An integer defining the percentage of draws from the gibbs sampler
that should be discarded as burn in (see \code{MCMCglmm}).}
}
\value{
The function returns a \code{mids} object. See \code{mice} for further information.
}
\description{
The user has to pass his data to the function.
Optionally he passes his analysis model formula so that \code{hmi} runs the imputation model
in line with his analysis model formula.\cr
And of course he can specify some parameters for the imputation routine
(like the number of imputations and iterations) including Gibbs-sampler parameters
(number of iterations, burnin and thinning.\cr
