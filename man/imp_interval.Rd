\title{The function to impute interval data variables}
\usage{
imp_interval(y_imp, X_imp)
}
\arguments{
\item{y_imp}{A Vector from the class \code{interval} with the variable to impute.}

\item{X_imp}{A data.frame with the fixed effects variables.}
}
\value{
A n x 1 data.frame with the original and imputed values.
Note that this function won't return \code{interval} data as its purpose is to
"break" the interval answers into precise answers.
}
\description{
This functions imputes interval data variables. Those are variables,
that consists of a lower and upper (numeric) boundary. Technically
those boundaries are cointained in a string, separated by a semi colon.
E.g. if a person reports there income to be something between 3000 and 4000 dollars,
its value in the interval covariate would be \code{"3000;4000"}.
Left (resp. right) censored data can be denoted by \code{"-Inf;x"} (resp. \code{"x;Inf"}),
with \code{x} being the (numeric) observed value.
