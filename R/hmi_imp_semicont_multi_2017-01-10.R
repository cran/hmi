#' The function for hierarchical imputation of semicontinous variables.
#'
#' The function is called by the wrapper. We consider data to be "semicontinuous" when
#' more than 5\% of the (non categorical) observations.\cr
#' For example in surveys a certain portion of people, when asked for their income,
#' report "0", which clearly violates the assumption of income to be (log-) normally distributed.
#' @param y_imp_multi A Vector with the variable to impute.
#' @param X_imp_multi A data.frame with the fixed effects variables.
#' @param Z_imp_multi A data.frame with the random effects variables.
#' @param model_formula A \code{\link[stats]{formula}} used for the analysis model.
#' @param heap A numeric saying to which (single) values the data might be heaped.
#' @param clID A vector with the cluster ID.
#' @param M An integer defining the number of imputations that should be made.
#' @param nitt An integer defining number of MCMC iterations (see MCMCglmm).
#' @param thin An integer defining the thinning interval (see MCMCglmm).
#' @param burnin An integer defining the percentage of draws from the gibbs sampler
#' that should be discarded as burn in (see MCMCglmm).
#' @return A n x M matrix. Each column is one of M imputed y-variables.
