#' The function for hierarchical imputation of semicontinuous variables.
#'
#' The function is called by the wrapper. We consider data to be "semicontinuous" when
#' more than 5\% of the (non categorical) observations.\cr
#' For example in surveys a certain portion of people, when asked for their income,
#' report "0", which clearly violates the assumption of income to be (log-) normally distributed.
#' @param y_imp A Vector with the variable to impute.
#' @param X_imp A data.frame with the fixed effects variables.
#' @param Z_imp A data.frame with the random effects variables.
#' @param heap A numeric value saying to which values the data might be heaped.
#' @param clID A vector with the cluster ID.
#' @param nitt An integer defining number of MCMC iterations (see MCMCglmm).
#' @param burnin burnin A numeric value between 0 and 1 for the desired percentage of
#' Gibbs samples that shall be regarded as burnin.
#' @param thin An integer to set the thinning interval range. If thin = 1,
#' every iteration of the Gibbs-sampling chain will be kept. For highly autocorrelated
#' chains, that are only examined by few iterations (say less than 1000).
#' @param rounding_degrees A numeric vector with the presumed rounding degrees.
#' @return A list with 1. 'y_ret' the n x 1 data.frame with the original and imputed values.
#' 2. 'Sol' the Gibbs-samples for the fixed effects parameters.
#' 3. 'VCV' the Gibbs-samples for variance parameters.
