#' The function for hierarchical imputation of semicontinuous variables.
#'
#' The function is called by the wrapper. We consider data to be "semicontinuous" when
#' more than 5\% of the (non categorical) observations.\cr
#' For example in surveys a certain portion of people, when asked for their income,
#' report "0", which clearly violates the assumption of income to be (log-) normally distributed.
#' @param y_imp A Vector with the variable to impute.
#' @param X_imp A data.frame with the fixed effects variables.
#' @param spike A numeric value saying to which value Y might be spiked.
#' @param pvalue A numeric between 0 and 1 denoting the threshold of p-values a variable in the imputation
#' model should not exceed. If they do, they are excluded from the imputation model.
#' @param k An integer defining the allowed maximum of levels in a factor covariate.
#' @return A n x 1 data.frame with the original and imputed values.
#' @export
